# Contributing to this repo

We love your input! We want to make contributing to this project as easy and transparent as possible, whether it's:

- Reporting a bug
- Discussing the current state of the code
- Submitting a fix
- Proposing new features
- Becoming a maintainer

## We Develop with Github

We use github to host code, to track issues and feature requests, as well as accept pull requests.

## We Use [Github Flow](https://guides.github.com/introduction/flow/index.html), So All Code Changes Happen Through Pull Requests

Pull requests are the best way to propose changes to the codebase (we use [Github Flow](https://guides.github.com/introduction/flow/index.html)). We actively welcome your pull requests:

1. Fork the repo and create your branch from `master`.
1. If you've added code that should be tested, add tests.
1. If you've changed APIs, update the documentation.
1. Ensure the test suite passes.
1. Make sure your code lints.
1. Issue that pull request!

## Any contributions you make will be under the MIT Software License

In short, when you submit code changes, your submissions are understood to be under the same [MIT License](http://choosealicense.com/licenses/mit/) that covers the project. Feel free to contact the maintainers if that's a concern.

## Report bugs using Github's [issues](https://github.com/briandk/transcriptase-atom/issues)

We use GitHub issues to track public bugs. Report a bug by [opening a new issue](); it's that easy!

## Write bug reports with detail, background, and sample code

[This is an example](http://stackoverflow.com/q/12488905/180626) of a bug report I wrote, and I think it's not a bad model. Here's [another example from Craig Hockenberry](http://www.openradar.me/11905408), an app developer whom I greatly respect.

**Great Bug Reports** tend to have:

- A quick summary and/or background
- Steps to reproduce
  - Be specific!
  - Give sample code if you can. [My stackoverflow question](http://stackoverflow.com/q/12488905/180626) includes sample code that *anyone* with a base R setup can run to reproduce what I was seeing
- What you expected would happen
- What actually happens
- Notes (possibly including why you think this might be happening, or stuff you tried that didn't work)

People *love* thorough bug reports. I'm not even kidding.

## Development

For use this project in your local machine it's recommended to create a python virtual environment. To manually create a virtualenv on MacOS and Linux:

```bash
python3 -m venv .env
```

After the init process completes and the virtualenv is created, you can use the following
step to activate your virtualenv.

```bash
source .env/bin/activate
```

Once the virtualenv is activated, you can install the required dependencies.

```bash
pip3 install -r requirements.txt
```

### Pre-commit

A pre-commit configuration file is provided in this repo to perform some linterns, validations and so on in order to avoid commit code to the repo that later will fail in validations step in the build pipeline.

The first execution can be slower because of installation of dependencies. Further executions will use the pre-commit cache.

#### Pre-commit requirements

In order to use pre-commit with all the hooks declared you need to install the following:

- [Pre-commit](https://pre-commit.com/#install)
- [Markdownlint](https://github.com/markdownlint/markdownlint) (also requires ruby)
- [Shellcheck](https://github.com/koalaman/shellcheck)
- [pylint](https://www.pylint.org/#install)

#### Use pre-commit

Once you have all the requirements achieved, you have to install pre-commit in the local repository:

```bash
pre-commit install
```

And you can test it's working with the following:

```bash
âžœ pre-commit run --all-files

Check for added large files..............................................Passed
Check for case conflicts.................................................Passed
Check that executables have shebangs.................(no files to check)Skipped
